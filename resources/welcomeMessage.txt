Good day Logan, I do hope this day greats you well.

My name is Sofia, and I am your assistant.  If you need additional help,
please see the help menu located at the top of the screen.

You can update a wide variety of configuration options from the config menu.
These are things such as turning on advanced features that help speed up
the grading by automatically moving forward after grading each lab.

Anything saved in config will be written to a .cfg file and loaded next time
so that you do not have to worry about resetting settings.  I can handle that for you!

All of the imports into the system can be found under file.  Again do not worry, once
you bring a file into the system (like the class list)  I will record that for you and
make sure to load it nex time we start up again.

If I can do anything to help, please let me know.
